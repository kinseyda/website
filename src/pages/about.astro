            I'm Daniel Kinsey, a software developer in Ottawa with a passion for
            solving problems.

            In 2025, I graduated summa cum laude from the University of Ottawa
            with a degree in Computer Science. During my time as a student, I
            worked as a web developer at two internships.

            My favorite animal is the mole, hence the picture of Monty <span
              class="hidden md:inline">on the left.</span

            <span class="inline md:hidden">above.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time I love tinkering with new technologies on my home
            server (serving you this website). I also love music; I play guitar
            decently and piano poorly. I also practice Olympic style archery,
            which I also coached when I was younger. And like every other nerd,
            I love PC gaming as well.
