              This website was built to act as a portfolio and a demonstration
              of my home server. The site is made with Astro and Vue, using
              daisyui's tailwindcss components, and paper.js for the background
              animation. My resume is written in LaTeX and compiled along with
              the website. The main branch gets built in a Docker image and
              served with nginx, which my home server pulls and runs. The server
              is an old refurbished ThinkCenter running Debian, and all traffic
              is routed through Cloudflare and an internal nginx reverse proxy.
              The server hosts a few other services as well for friends and
              family.

              Divinimity is a web application for playing Divinim, a turn-based
              strategy game I created. The game started as my honours project at
              the University of Ottawa, where I researched optimal strategies
              for the game. The original idea came from my supervisor, Jean-Lou
              De Carufel, who saw a copy of James Tanton's <i>
                Solve This: Math Activities for Students and Clubs</i
              >. In its original form, the game only ever has one marked /
              poisoned tile, and we abstracted the game to allow for multiple
              marked tiles, as well as different winning conditions and
              rulesets.
            </p>
            <p>
              The web application is hosted on my home server, and consists of
              an Astro / Vue front-end, with a Node.js / Express back-end, and a
              RethinkDB database allowing for real-time multiplayer games.

              Wikid is a terminal interface for reading offline Wikipedia dumps.
              It was built using Go and the Bubble Tea TUI framework. It uses
              pandoc to convert the MediaWiki markup to terminal-friendly
              markdown, and indexes the articles and metadata using Meilisearch.

              Muziko is a website that allows users to post comments on songs,
              albums, and artists. The goal of the project was to create a
              vertical slice of a full web application. The front-end was built
              with React, using Tailwind and daisyui for styling. It includes
              multiple themes, uses responsive design, has full language
              support, and was built with accessibility in mind. The back-end
              uses Firebase for user authentication with Firestore as a database
              for the comments. The music data is pulled from Spotify's API.

              Neural Playground is a web application that allows users to
              experiment with neural networks. It was built as a personal
              project to learn more about machine learning and neural networks,
              with my goal being to create the entire network in the browser,
              using only my own code. The result is a Typescript implementation
              of a simple feedforward neural network and an implementation of
              the backpropagation algorithm, including the vector math that goes
              along with that. Since the entire network is implemented in
              Typescript and runs in the browser, it is not very performant, but
              it is educational. The user can create a network, train it on a
              small dataset, and see it learn in real time. Provided datasets
              are all basic logic gates and functions on small numbers, in order
              to get a fast result. To display the network as a graph, I used
              vis.js.

              Moles is a text-based incremental game where you manage a colony
              of moles. These sorts of games are often pejoratively called
              "clicker" / "idle" games, which may be a more familiar name to
              you. They are very addicting to me, so I was inspired to make one
              as my first web project. It was built using Vue and plain
              TypeScript / HTML / CSS, all the components and visual effects
              were created by me.

              ArchMark is an Android app that allows users to quickly score
              archery rounds. It was the first "real" project I worked on as a
              programmer, and so I don't know if it deserves a place here, but
              it holds a special place in my heart and so I'm including it. It
              was built using Kotlin and the Android SDK.
