# Personal Website

This is the git repo for my personal website, kinseyda.com. Built using Astro.

This website was built to act as a portfolio and a demonstration of my home
server. The site is made with Astro and Vue, using daisyui's tailwindcss
components, and paper.js for the background animation. My resume is written in
LaTeX and compiled along with the website. The main branch gets built in a
Docker image and served with nginx, which my home server pulls and runs.
